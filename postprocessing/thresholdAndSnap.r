## for making thresholded tiffs for Charlie for already completed models


## this is a temporary work around for use untill we get the export polygon and raster
## export cleaned up in the primary scripts. 

## this is simply a modified version of the "exportForMapReviewTool.r" script.
##  You need to set paths on lines 17, 18, 43, 46
