# A brief overview of the setup process to run these scripts
 - Make sure there are appropriate entries in these tables in the sqlite DB (SDM_lookupAndTracking.sqlite)
   - lkpDataSources
   - lkpEnvVars
   - lkpModelers
   - lkpRange
   - lkpSpecies
   - lkpSpeciesRubric
 - Make sure there are appropriate entries in the SQL Server (HSM_Tracker) DB. 
   This only matters for metadata output and could eventually be optionally 
   shifted to the SQLite DB. 
 - Collate and/or create links to environmental variable data sets (see
   https://github.com/HeritageNetwork/Regional_SDM/wiki/User-Customizations)
 - Ensure you've got layers for "HUC10" and "US_States" in the `other_spatial/feature` folder. 
 - Make a set of background points by running `preproc_makeBackgroundPoints.r`
 - Attribute the background points by running `preproc_attributeBackgroundPoints.r`
